## ❓ Troubleshooting & FAQ

**Q: The extension isn't changing the course codes on a page.**
- **A:** Make sure you have enabled the extension for that specific website (click the icon → toggle ON).

**Q: It's not working inside an embedded Google Sheet or Document.**
- **A:** Some embedded documents use "iframes". The extension supports iframes — just make sure the parent domain is in your allowlist.

**Q: Will it break charts or graphs on my university portal?**
- **A:** No! The extension intentionally skips SVG elements to avoid breaking charts (like Highcharts) and other visual data elements.

**Q: I pasted JSON but my courses didn't update.**
- **A:** Make sure your JSON is a valid, flat object (all keys and values in double quotes). A red error message will show if the format is incorrect.

**Q: Will I lose my custom courses if I reload the file?**
- **A:** No! Custom courses are saved in a separate persistent storage layer. They will survive updates and automatically merge with the default list.
